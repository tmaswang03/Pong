# Pong (Learning Javascript)
 Mini project used to learn how to use javascript. Circle object used from Chris Courses. This project was meant just for me to gain knowledge as to the syntax and OOP used within Javascript. Implemented JS Canvas. The logic behind the code was made from intuition (based off of what I perceived the game to be like). There are a few bugs, most specifically with the collisions between blocks and circle. 
 
 Objective : Obtain the highest score possible, score increases via hitting the ball with the rectangular box on the right
 
 Game Rules : 
  Every 5 points you score the speed of the ball increases by 1 more pixel/frame
  The ball speed is capped at 30 pixels/frame 
  Once the ball hits the wall on the right side of the game the game ends 
 
Controls : 
 To hit ball use rectangular plane on the right
 Use 'W' key to accelerate the rectangle upwards
 Use 'S' key to accelerate the rectangle downwards
 Hit anywhere to restart after death
